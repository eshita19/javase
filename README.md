## Generics:
   - It is possible to create a single class, which will work with different types - Using Generics.
   -  Generics work only with reference types.
   - Generics give compile time safety. Generic type differ based on their type arguments. We could also work on different types by creating variable of type Object. But it would result in runtime exceptions if two objects of Generic type are not compatible (Integer and String).
   ```
   iob = strob
   int val = (Integer) iob.getVal(); // run-time error
   ```
